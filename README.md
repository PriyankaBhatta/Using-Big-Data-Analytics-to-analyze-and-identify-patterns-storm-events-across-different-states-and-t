# Using-Big-Data-Analytics-to-understand-storm-events-across-different-zones-in-USA-for-year-2022

This repository presents an analysis of storm events data for the year 2022 in the United States. The data was obtained from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and includes information on various types of weather events, their severity, and the extent of damage caused. The primary objective of the analysis was to identify patterns and insights into the distribution and frequency of weather events across different states and months in the United States.

The analysis involved exploratory data analysis, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization. The data was first cleaned and preprocessed, and several visualizations were created to explore the distribution of events across different states and months. It was found that the highest number of events occurred in the months of June and May. Additionally, a clustering analysis was performed using KMeans and DBSCAN algorithms to group similar events together and identify outliers. The results showed that the events could be grouped into clusters, each representing a different type of weather event.

Overall, this analysis provides insights into the frequency and distribution of weather events in the United States in 2022. The results can be used by emergency responders, policymakers, and other stakeholders to better prepare and respond to weather-related disasters in the future.
